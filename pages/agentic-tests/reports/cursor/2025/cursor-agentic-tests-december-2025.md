# Summary

Cursor is an LLM-backed IDE developed on VSCode basement. Cursor provides a wide variety of popular LLM to assist with
software development.

The new agent version showed better performance with solving tasks and moved into the leading positions, according to
agentic testing results. It has been found that the initial solutions may be incomplete or may not meet the required
specifications. It is recommended to review the generated code carefully to identify and address flaws and shortcomings
if any exist.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation,
solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

# Testing

## Environment

|               | Version              |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Cursor        | 2.1.50               |
| Default Model | claude-4.5-opus-high |
| Run Mode      | Agent                |

## Code Generation Findings

- Has embedded review agent reviewing changes generated with coding agent.
- May add unrequested changes while working on review comments.
- Can suggest simplified straightforward solutions.
- May generate custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
- Can ask clarifying questions.
- Has a debug mode.
