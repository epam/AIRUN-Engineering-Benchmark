## Summary

Cursor is an LLM-backed IDE developed on VSCode basement. Cursor provides wide variety of popular LLM to assist with software development.

The new agent version showed better performance with solving tasks. However, there are some drawbacks. For instance, it tends to suggest a simplified straightforward solutions. The agent still has difficulties with tasks requiring modification of numerous source files.

The issue affecting performance is troubles with discovering and choosing right external tool available on the workstation, the agent tries to execute tool one by one until it completes successfully.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

When faced with a complex task requiring spending many tokens, as in some .NET tests, Cursor periodically stops its work and asks the user to confirm the continuation of work.

## Testing

### Environment

|                    | Version |
|--------------------|---------|
| Cursor             | Version: 1.2.2 (user setup)<br>VSCode Version: 1.99.3<br>Commit: faa03b17cce93e8a80b7d62d57f5eda6bb6ab9f0<br>Date: 2025-07-07T06:19:13.016Z<br>Electron: 34.5.1<br>Chromium: 132.0.6834.210<br>Node.js: 20.19.0<br>V8: 13.2.152.41-electron.0<br>OS: Windows_NT x64 10.0.26100 |

### Code Generation Findings

- Has difficulties with processing of multiple data classes. For instance, reverse engineering of JPA entity classes results to DDL scripts with missing tables, columns, etc, suffers from incorrect order of table creation scripts. (Feedback allows to fix only one elementary issue one by one.)
- May forget a developer instructions during a session.
- May generate custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
- Tends to suggest a simplified straightforward solution. It is laborious and time-consuming to force the agent to rework the solution following a better approach. A developer have to provide a lot of granular instructions how to improve and/or fix the solution code.
- Terminal commands running by the agent may hang from time to time.
- May change line endings from Unix format to Windows one.
- Can not choose right tool available on the workstation, tries to execute tool one by one until it completes successfully. For instance, the agent can start with Unix tool, realizes it is not available, move to Windows Command Prompt (CMD) tool, then move to use PowerShell tool.
