# Summary
GitHub Copilot Agent is an integral part of GitHub Copilot Visual Studio Code extension.

The new agent version showed better performance with solving tasks. However, it still suffers from some drawbacks. For instance, it tends to suggest a simplified straightforward solutions or to do over-engineering. The agent still has difficulties with tasks requiring modification of numerous source files.

The agent does not provide the opportunity to review and criticize the implementation plan, and immediately begins generating code. The annoying issue is restoring files created and deleted during previous iterations.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

## Code Generation Findings
- Completes a task partially while it is still required modification of numerous source files.
- May ignore developer instructions.
- May generate custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
- Tends to suggest a simplified straightforward solution. It is laborious and time-consuming to force the agent to rework the solution following a better approach. A developer have to provide a lot of granular instructions how to improve and/or fix the solution code.
- Tends to over-engineering, sometimes it may cause extra time be spent investigating and fixing unrequested changes.
- Create a separate usage instructions fro each iteration instead of updating instructions created previously.
- Resurrects removed generated files.
- Creates tests to check the generated solution.
