## Summary

Codex IDE extension is a coding agent provided as VS Code extension.

The agent showed rather good performance with solving tasks close to results of the previous run. However, the agent may miss some requested changes or suggest plain straightforward solutions. The agent may try to invent workarounds when it cannot find root cause of issues.

The generated code should be supervised by an experienced developer to prevent defects and technical debt introduction.

The implementation plan is not shown; the agent starts to generate a solution immediately.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

## Testing

### Environment

|                        | Version                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| OpenAI Codex Extension | 0.5.35                          |
| IDE                    | Visual Studio Code Insiders<br>Version: 1.106.0-insider |
| Payment Plan           | GitHub Copilot Pro              |
| Auth                   | via GitHub Copilot              |
| Default Model          | GPT-5-Codex (medium)            |

### Code Generation Findings

- The agent has difficulties with adapting to the development environment and available tools.
- May generate custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
- It may be laborious and time-consuming to force the agent to rework the solution following a better approach. A developer has to provide a lot of granular instructions how to improve and/or fix the solution code.
- The agent tries to invent workarounds when it cannot find root cause of issues.
