## Summary

Codex IDE extension is a coding agent provided as a VS Code extension.

The agent showed one of the best performances in solving tasks. There are some drawbacks, however. For instance, it tends to suggest simplified, straightforward solutions.

The implementation plan is not shown; the agent starts to generate a solution immediately.

The context and history are not kept; they disappear after IDE restart or project close.

The agent UI is far from perfect.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component generation, solution migration, code refactoring, and code bugfixing.

## Testing

### Environment

|                        | Version    |
|------------------------|------------|
| OpenAI Codex Extension  | 0.4.0      |
| Payment Plan           | Team       |
| Default Model          | GPT-5      |
| Agent Mode             | Full access|
| Reasoning Effort       | Medium     |

### Code Generation Findings

- The default agent mode is too intrusive, asking for every single action and not allowing general approval. Conversely, full access mode seems insecure. The extension pushes for full access.
- May show changes for one file and ask approval for another.
- Requests file edit approvals one by one, keeping users tied to the IDE.
- May keep unused code leftover from previous iterations.
- Formulates open questions to refine the solution.
