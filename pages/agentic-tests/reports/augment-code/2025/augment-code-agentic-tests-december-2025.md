# Summary

Augment Code is a coding agent that can be run as a VS Code extension. The extension comes with a mature and well-designed
UI. It provides nice features making work on tasks easier. Prompt Enhance allows refining a task prompt and converting it
to a detailed technical specification a developer can review and adjust before passing it to implementation. Tasks
feature allows refining the implementation plan by editing sub-task list.

The agent showed one of the best performances among the examined agents. It successfully completed the tasks assigned to
it. The agent responded reasonably to the feedback, which allowed successfully achieving a goal in a minimum number of
steps. However, the agent may suggest plain straightforward solutions. The generated code should be supervised by an
experienced developer to prevent defects and technical debt introduction.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation,
solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing. In response, the agent generated solutions affecting from 3 files
and 28 code lines till 10 files and 621 code lines. It took from 1 to 4 iterations to complete the given development
either successfully or to prove that further agent-assisted development was not reasonable.

# Testing

## Environment

|               | Version         |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Augment Code  | 0.654.1         |
| Default Model | Claude Opus 4.5 |
| Run Mode      | Agent           |

## Code Generation Findings

- There is a Prompt Enhance feature allowing refining a task prompt and converting it to a detailed technical
  specification a developer can review and adjust before passing it to implementation.
- There is a Tasks feature where the agent can help to make a plan and can refine it with a developer, and break it down
  in a task list.
- Breaks down a complex task into sub-tasks and tracks the sub-tasks completion.
- May generate custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
- Can ask clarifying questions.
