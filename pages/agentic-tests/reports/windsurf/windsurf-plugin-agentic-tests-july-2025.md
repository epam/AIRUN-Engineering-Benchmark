## Summary
Windsurf JetBrains Plugin contains coding agent powered by popular LLM to assist with software development.

The plugin agent version showed about the same performance as a standalone Windsurf Editor IDE. It also suffers from some drawbacks. For instance, it tends to suggest simplified, straightforward solutions. The agent has difficulties with tasks with complex context requiring modification of numerous source files.

The agent does not provide the opportunity to review and criticize the implementation plan, and immediately begins generating code.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

## Testing

### Environment
|                 | Version                                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Windsurf Plugin | 2.4.0                                               |
| JetBrains IDE   | IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1.3 (Community Edition)          |
| Payment Plan    | Pro                                                 |
| Default Model   | Claude Sonnet 4                                     |

### Code Generation Findings
- Completes a task partially while it is still required modification of numerous source files.
- There are difficulties in solving tasks with complex contextual relationships.
- May hang while running terminal command.
- May leave debug code.
