## Summary

Zencoder Coding Agent is an integral part of *Zencoder: AI Coding Agent and Chat* Visual Studio Code extension and *Zencoder: Your Mindful AI Coding Agent* JetBrains plugin.

The agent showed the best performance among the examined agents. It mostly successfully completed the tasks assigned to it. The agent responded reasonably to the feedback, which allowed to successfully achieve a goal in a minimum number of steps. However **it can respond to feedback inaccurately, hallucinate and invent workarounds. External tools usage is buggy and confusing**. Although the suggested solutions are generally good, the code generation should be supervised by an experienced developer to prevent defects and technical debt introduction.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing. In response, the agent generated solutions affecting from 3 files and 18 code lines till 11 files and 401 code lines. It took from 1 to 7 iterations to complete the given development either successfully or to prove that further agent-assisted development was not reasonable. 5-15 minutes long to generate a usual response, which is quite slow.

## Testing

### Environment

### Code Generation Findings

- Relatively long code generation time, it takes from five to fifteen minutes.
- May add unrequested code modifications.
- May suggest a primitive straightforward solution.
- May generated custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
- May interrupt solution generation halfway. The generation can be continued after an arbitrary feedback.
- It may be a laborious and time-consuming to force the agent to rework the solution to fix the solution issues.
