## Summary

Anthropic Claude Code is a command line coding agent working in a terminal.

The agent showed one of the best performance among the examined agents. It mostly successfully completed the tasks assigned to it. The agent responded reasonably to the feedback, which allowed to successfully achieve a goal in a minimum number of steps. However the agent may tend to do over-engineering or suggest unrequested changes or suggest plain straightforward solutions. The generated code should be supervised by an experienced developer to prevent defects and technical debt introduction. In .NET tests, the agent was slower than expected.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing. In response, the agent generated solutions affecting from 3 files and 12 code lines till 19 files and 417 code lines. It took from 1 to 8 iterations to complete the given development either successfully or to prove that further agent-assisted development was not reasonable.

## Code Generation Findings

- tends to over-engineering, sometimes it may cause extra time be spent investigating and fixing unrequested changes
- generates multiple solutions for one problem, causing unwanted changes, time may be spent fixing unwanted changes
- generated code can have non-obvious issues due to recurring usage of magic values
- extra time can be spent after moving in direction of suggested incorrect solution
- it may be a laborious and time-consuming to force the agent to rework the initial solution to fix the solution issues.
- may generated custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
