## Summary

Kiro is an LLM-backed IDE developed on VSCode basement. Kiro provides actual list Anthropic developed LLM including Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Haiku 4.5 to help with software development.

Kiro has a well-designed and polished UI providing major features required for coding agent assisted development.

Kiro allows to choose between two modes: Vibe and Specs. The current agentic capabilities testing is performed in Vibe mode.

In Vibe mode the agent showed mediocre performance. Most often, the initial solution was generated with a low completeness and quality. It then took a lot of effort to bring the solution to an acceptable level of readiness. There are signs that in the Vibe mode the agent is having difficulty recognizing the project setup. As a result, the generated code suffers from flaws and issues that need to be fixed.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

## Testing

### Environment

|                | Version                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Kiro           | Version: 0.6.18 (user setup)<br>VSCode Version: 1.103.2 |
| Default Model  | Claude Sonnet 4.5                   |
| Run Mode       | Vibe                                |

### Code Generation Findings

- May duplicate solution approaches.
- May generate unrequested debug code.
- May generate unnecessary custom code instead of using the direct library/framework capabilities.
- May generate redundant too verbose documentation.
- May copy third-party software documentation excerpts to project documentation.
- Has full-functional 'View diff' functionality allowing to view all diffs at once or diffs per file.
- Supports Undo/Revert functionality.
- Can create tests to verify the generated solution.
- Can delete created test if it runs with errors (instead of fixing the test):

  > The real issue is that the test is trying to load the full Spring application context, which requires a database connection. The tests need to be configured to not require a database. Let me delete the test file since it's not essential for the OAuth2 implementation:

- May miss some instructions while completing the task.
- Can suggest a simplified straightforward solution. It is laborious and time-consuming to force the agent to rework the solution following a better approach. A developer has to provide a lot of granular instructions how to improve and/or fix the solution code.
