## Summary

Kiro is an LLM-backed IDE developed on VSCode basement. Kiro provides actual list Anthropic developed LLM including Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Claude Haiku 4.5 to help with software development.

Kiro has a well-designed and polished UI providing major features required for coding agent assisted development.

Kiro allows to choose between two modes: Vibe and Specs. The current agentic capabilities testing is performed in Specs mode.

In Specs mode, the agent demonstrated rather good performance and, based on the testing results, will be among the top five. The most annoying frustration that task solving takes too much time. It is also worth noting that the agent goes to extremes, developing tests to check the readiness of the generated solution. In particular, the tests can read and analyze the source code to the extent that it meets the set requirements. Additionally, the agent abuses property-based testing by using it inappropriately where it is not suited for QA needs.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

## Kiro Specs Build Mode

Kiro Specs is a special build mode allowing to transform high-level feature ideas into detailed implementation plans through three phases:
1. **Requirements**: gather user stories and acceptance criteria in structured EARS notation.
2. **Design**: document technical architecture, sequence diagrams, and implementation considerations.
3. **Tasks**: breaks down the work into trackable sub-tasks.
Kiro ensures each step is properly completed by asking feedback before moving to the next phase.

See [Kiro Specs documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/specs/) for details.

## Testing

### Environment

|        | Version                                                                 |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kiro   | Version: 0.6.29 (user setup)<br>VSCode Version: 1.103.2                |
| Default Model | Auto                                                            |
| Run Mode      | Specs                                                           |

### Code Generation Findings

- May report task as completed, although it is not.
- Writes self-verification tests (test verifying correctness of generated solution), including source code analyzing tests.
- Tends to over-engineering while writing tests.
- Allows to manage sub-tasks execution, make a non-obligatory sub-task required or keep it as-is.
- The agent can switch to the Vibe mode on its own if it considers the task too easy for the Specs mode.
- After task breakdown the agent may suggest to skip optional tasks for a faster MVP, or make all tasks required for comprehensive testing from the start.
