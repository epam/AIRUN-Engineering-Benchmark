# Roo Code Agent Tests - September 2025

# Summary
Roo Code is a coding agent provided as VS Code extension. Its distinctive features are the provision of specialized modes designed to solve various problems, including Сode Mode, Architect Mode, Ask Mode, Debug Mode. Orchestrator Mode allows to manage complex tasks and delegating work to dedicated modes. The user is also given the opportunity to create his own modes. The agent comes with set of tools allowing to read and write files, execute commands, debug a code, automate interaction with a web browser. External tools are supported via MCP. The agent supports a wide range of AI models available via connection to AI providers.

The agent design supposes its ability to work on development task almost autonomously with minimal human involvement. On other side, it includes features allowing the developer to keep control over development: checkpoints, flexible permission settings, visual diffs.

Roo Code is well-developed, but there are areas to improve. For instance, the adaptation to system environment can be better, sometimes the agent fails to adjust completely to recognized system services and tries workarounds. The file diff feature can be more convenient too.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing. In response, the agent generated solutions affecting from 6 files and 64 code lines till 27 files and 7000 code lines. It took from 1 to 13 iterations to complete the given development either successfully or to prove that further agent-assisted development was not reasonable.

The agent's final grade is 57%, but it could be better if the testing goes another way. First half of tests were performed exclusively in orchestrator mode. Later the approach was changed: the initial task was given in the orchestrator mode, and the finalization was carried out in the code mode. In the orchestrator mode the agent tries to finish the task completely, tests the final solution autonomously. It takes a time and often accompanied by debugging modifications. Many iterations are spent to revert the modifications back or isolate in test profile. On contrary, the code mode is better for minor improvement and fixes.

The agent learning curve is rather high, it affects the grade.

# Testing

## Environment
|                | Version / Value |
| --- | --- |
| Roo Code | 3.27.0 - 3.28.2 |
| API Provider | GCP Vertex AI |
| Default Model | Claude Sonnet 4 |
| Interaction Mode(s) | Orchestrator, Code |
| Reasoning | Enabled |
| Auto-Approve | Read, Write, Mode, Subtasks, Execute, TODO |

## Code Generation Findings
- Automatically breaks down task into subtasks in Orchestrator mode
- Leaves notes about the reasons for removing unnecessary generated earlier code as comments  
  ![report-september1.png](../../../../../images/agent-tests/roo-code/2025/report-september1.png)
- Can create an architecture diagram for suggested solution  
  ![report-september2.png](../../../../../images/agent-tests/roo-code/2025/report-september2.png)
- Can ask clarifying questions
- Tests the generated solution
- Can debug generated solution
- Can use browser for debugging UI issues
- May generate custom code instead of using the library/framework capabilities.
- Adopts to local workstation environment and mitigates the environment setup. For instance, the agent can try to launch docker container or switch to in-memory database if the configured database is not accessible.
