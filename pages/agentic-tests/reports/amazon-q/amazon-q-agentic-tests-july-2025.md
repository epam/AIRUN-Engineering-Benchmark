## Summary

Amazon Q Developer Agent is an integral part of Amazon Q Developer extension. The extension can be installed in JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA and more), VS Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse. Also it can be used as command line tool.

The new agent version showed better performance with solving tasks. However, it still suffers from some drawbacks. For instance, it tends to suggest a simplified straightforward solutions. The agent still has difficulties with tasks with complex context requiring modification of numerous source files.

Previous version feature allowing to review the implementation plan before solution generation has been abandoned.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing.

## Testing

### Scope

Only the core Amazon Q agent capability is tested: generating new code across your entire project and implement features.

### Environment

|                    | Version                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Amazon Q extension | 1.85.0                  |
| Visual Studio Code | 1.102.1                 |
| Pricing Tier       | Amazon Q Developer Pro Tier |
| Default Model      | Claude Sonnet 4         |

### Code Generation Findings

- May generate unnecessary custom code replacing the library/framework capabilities.
- Tends to suggest a simplified straightforward solution. It is laborious and time-consuming to force the agent to rework the solution following a better approach. A developer has to provide a lot of granular instructions how to improve and/or fix the solution code.
- Tries random or near-random fixes without a clear understanding of the root cause of the bug, hoping that one of their attempts will resolve the issue.
- May forget previously given requirements during iterative work on the task.
