## Summary

Sourcegraph Amp is a coding agent that can be run as VS Code extension and as a command-line tool. Amp is unconstrained on token usage and will always use the best model(s). The agent distinctive feature is a multiplayer support — a developer can share threads and collaborate with team.

The agent showed one of the best performance among the examined agents. It successfully completed the tasks assigned to it. The agent responded reasonably to the feedback, which allowed to successfully achieve a goal in a minimum number of steps. However the agent may tend to do over-engineering or suggest unrequested changes or suggest plain straightforward solutions. The generated code should be supervised by an experienced developer to prevent defects and technical debt introduction. Some activities can take quite a long time. For instance, calling a subagent to make changes to multiple files can last for tens of minutes.

The agent has been examined with tasks belonging to various categories such as solution-or-component-generation, solution-migration, code-refactoring, code-bugfixing. In response, the agent generated solutions affecting from 3 files and 12 code lines till 29 files and 471 code lines. It took from 1 to 7 iterations to complete the given development either successfully or to prove that further agent-assisted development was not reasonable.

## Testing

### Environment

|                    | Version            |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Sourcegraph Amp    | 0.0.1749111215<br>(Research Preview) |
| Payment Plan       | N/A                |
| Default Model      | Claude Sonnet 4    |

### Code Generation Findings

- May incorrectly interpret external tool calls. For instance, call of `mvn test -Dtest=OAuth2SecurityConfigTest` was reported 'Process exited with code 1',  but it was ignored.
- May create unit tests those do not test any functionality. For instance, test can assert if a constant is equals to its value.
- May tend to over-engineering while generating solution, sometimes it may cause extra time be spent investigating and fixing issues with unrequested unnecessary functionality.
- May generate custom code instead of using the proven library/framework capabilities.
- May apply unsolicited refactoring while working on another problem.
- Calling a subagent to make changes to multiple files can take quite a long time.

### Testing Customization

Amp supports AGENT.md file in workspace directory. It provides the AI model with project-specific information about codebase structure, development practices, and coding standards.

The Amp was ordered to generate AGENT.md automatically before running tests.
