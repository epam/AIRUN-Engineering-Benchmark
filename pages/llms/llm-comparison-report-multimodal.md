## Conclusion

The benchmark results identify three top-performing models: GPT5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro. Considering execution time and price the best choice is Gemini 2.5 Flash.
Claude 4 Sonnet takes middle position. Thinking mode slightly improves accuracy (60.69% vs. 56.68%) but takes 72% more time (18.602 min vs. 10.832 min).
Amazon Nova Premier delivers mid-level performance (53.29%) with a moderate execution time (14.849 min).
Grok 4 finishes in last place (43.78%) with the slowest execution time (66.464 min), making it impractical for most use cases.
