# LLMs Leaderboard (Benchmark v2, last update 2025-05-07)

![llm-rating.png](/images/llms/llm-rating.png)

## Introduction

This page compares the effectiveness of Anthropic, Amazon, Google DeepMind, Meta, xAI, OpenAI, and other companies' LLMs in executing software engineering tasks, including code translation, code
generation, documentation generation, and large context instruction following (LCIF).

Our latest research and evaluations have revealed significant shifts in large language model performance. Leading our rankings is Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview with an exceptional 94.47% total score,
showcasing Google's continued advancement in LLM capabilities. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview follows closely in second place with 93.32% total score. OpenAI's newest model o3 (high) makes an impressive debut
at third place with 92.08% total score, demonstrating particular strength in code documentation (91.80%) and LCIF experiment (100%). xAI's Grok 3 mini beta now sits in fourth place with a strong
91.79% total score.

It's worth noting that Grok 3 mini beta achieves its high ranking largely due to its very fast token generation speed (152.47 tokens/second). In our methodology, we calculate speed by dividing the
total output tokens (including completion and reasoning tokens) by execution time. While Grok 3 mini generates tokens at a high rate, its total execution time of 24.05 minutes is nearly four times
longer than ChatGPT-4o's 6.53 minutes. This indicates that Grok 3 mini produces significantly more reasoning tokens during its process, trading raw execution speed for thoroughness in its approach.

OpenAI's new models show significant improvements and provide excellent options across different price points:

- o3 (92.08%) demonstrates exceptional capabilities, especially in code documentation, though at a premium price point ($10/$40 per MTok)
- o4-mini (90.56%) offers excellent value with strong performance at a more accessible price ($1.10/$4.40 per MTok)
- GPT-4.1 mini (88.87%) delivers impressive results at a very competitive price ($0.40/$1.60 per MTok), excelling in code generation (91.16%)
- GPT-4.1 (88.13%) provides solid performance with perfect LCIF scores at a reasonable price for premium services ($2.00/$8.00 per MTok)

An interesting and significant finding from our benchmark is that Grok 3 mini beta, which is a reasoning model, substantially outperformed the standard Grok 3 beta model (91.79% vs 88.65%), despite
being a "mini" version. This clearly demonstrates the substantial benefits of reasoning capabilities for software engineering tasks. The difference is particularly pronounced in code generation where
Grok 3 mini beta scored 91.79% compared to Grok 3 beta's 86.08%. This suggests that models with explicit reasoning mechanisms are better equipped to handle complex coding challenges.

Following the top models is Claude 3.7 Sonnet with 90.93% total score, and OpenAI's o4-mini model with 90.56%, followed by o3-mini model with 89.97%. These models demonstrate exceptional capabilities
in software engineering tasks while maintaining efficient processing times and reasonable costs.

The next position is held by Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) with 89.89%, showcasing the benefits of Anthropic's thinking mode feature. GPT-4.1 mini achieves an impressive 88.87% total score, followed by
xAI's flagship Grok 3 beta model at 88.65% and GPT-4.1 at 88.13%. ChatGPT-4o secures a position at 86.40%, offering an excellent balance of performance and speed.

OpenAI o1 (1217) at 84.16% and DeepSeek V3 (03-24) at 83.53% show similar performance. DeepSeek's open-source models have shown good capabilities, with the new V3 version (83.53%) outperforming R1 (
76.56%). These models are particularly noteworthy as they can be self-hosted within organizations seeking privacy, control, and cost optimization. This represents a significant advancement in the
open-source LLM space.

Meta's Llama 4 Maverick achieves a competitive 73.04% total score. This model uses a sophisticated mixture-of-experts architecture with 400B total parameters but only 17B active parameters at any
given time (using 128 experts). This architecture reduces inference latency while maintaining computational efficiency, allowing it to deliver solid performance with exceptional speed (103.21
tokens/sec) and very low cost ($0.05/$0.22 per MTok) at Fireworks.ai provider. This positions it as one of the most cost-effective options in our benchmark.

OpenAI's GPT-4.5 preview shows only middle-range results (77.47%). It generates a very small amount of tokens (37,894) while having the highest cost ($75/$150) among all tested models. This makes it
currently less efficient than other models in our benchmark.

Amazon Nova Pro, while scoring 60.61%, shows promise for enterprise applications. Given that it's a smaller model, its performance is noteworthy, and we anticipate significant improvements with the
upcoming Amazon Nova Premier model.

We have also evaluated OpenAI's newest o1-Pro model (released in March 2025). While this model shows promising capabilities, its extremely high cost ($150/$600 per 1M tokens) and extended processing
times make it impractical for standard benchmarking. Our initial tests revealed good accuracy but did not justify including it in our main leaderboard at this time. For detailed results of our o1-Pro
evaluation, please see our [dedicated report](llm-detailed-result/o1-pro-2025-03-25.md).

The current top of Large Language Models based on research, in order of Total Score, are:

1. Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (0417) - 94.47%
2. Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview (0325) - 93.32%
3. OpenAI o3 (high) (0416) - 92.08%
4. Grok 3 mini beta - 91.79%
5. Claude 3.7 Sonnet - 90.93%

For cost-effective options, Grok 3 mini beta (91.79% at $0.30/$0.50 per MTok) offers exceptional value with high speed, low cost, and strong performance specifically for software development tasks.
OpenAI's o4-mini (90.56% at $1.10/$4.40 per MTok) and GPT-4.1 mini (88.87% at $0.40/$1.60 per MTok) also provide excellent performance at competitive prices. While Llama 4 Maverick
(73.04% at $0.05/$0.22 per MTok) has lower costs, its strengths lie more in social networking applications rather than software development tasks.

We are looking forward to evaluating several upcoming models in the near future:

- Meta Llama 4 Behemoth
- Other models...
