# LLM's Evaluation Results

## Abstract

This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of leading Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple performance categories. Our benchmark compares different LLMs, including models from OpenAI,
Anthropic, Google Deepmind, xAI, Amazon, and open-source alternatives. The evaluation focused on four key areas: code translation, code generation, code documentation, and large context instruction
following (LCIF).

Key findings:

- Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental takes the lead with an impressive 93.4% total score
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet follows closely with 91.4% total score
- OpenAI's o3-mini model demonstrates exceptional performance at 90.9%, confirming its suitability for coding tasks
- ChatGPT-4o shows strong overall performance at 88.1%, making it a competitive option
- OpenAI o1 demonstrates solid capabilities at 84.6%, performing similarly to Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking
- DeepSeek V3, an open-source model that can be self-hosted, shows significant improvements over R1 at 84.0%
- Amazon Nova Pro, while smaller in size, achieves 62.0% and shows potential as we await the more powerful Amazon Nova Premier model

Best results by category:

- Code Translation: Gemini 2.5 Pro leads with 90.9%, followed by Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental at 90.5%
- Code Generation: Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks first (92.5%), followed by Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental (91.6%)
- Code Documentation: Gemini 2.5 Pro dominates with 90.1%, followed by OpenAI o3-mini (87.2%) and ChatGPT-4o (86.6%)
- LCIF: Four models achieve 100%: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking), and OpenAI o3-mini

The final conclusion in the [end](#conclusion) of the report.

_Table 5. LCIF results of LLMs in EPAM's LLMs Benchmark._

## Conclusion

The benchmark results reveal several significant insights about the current state of LLM capabilities:

1. Model Evolution and Leadership:
    - Google has taken the lead with Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental achieving the top position at 93.4% total score
    - Anthropic maintains strong market position with Claude 3.7 Sonnet at 91.4% total score
    - OpenAI shows competitive performance with o3-mini at 90.9% total score
    - ChatGPT-4o demonstrates strong performance at 88.1%, making it a viable option for many use cases
    - OpenAI o1 (1217) shows solid capabilities at 84.6%, comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking
    - Four models achieving perfect LCIF scores demonstrates advancement in handling complex instructions
    - DeepSeek's open-source models (V3 at 84.0% and R1 at 77.2%) represent significant achievements in the open-source space, allowing for self-hosting within organizations

2. Performance Patterns:
    - Specialized strengths emerge across different categories:
        * Code Translation: Gemini 2.5 Pro leads with 90.9%, followed by Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental at 90.5%
        * Code Generation: Gemini 2.5 Pro dominates with 92.5%, followed by Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental at 91.6%
        * Code Documentation: Gemini 2.5 Pro excels with 90.1%, followed by OpenAI o3-mini at 87.2% and ChatGPT-4o at 86.6%
        * LCIF: Four models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking), OpenAI o3-mini) achieve perfect scores
    - Top-tier models consistently achieve >90% scores across most categories
    - Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental continues to show incredible speed, achieving 188 tokens per second
    - Processing efficiency varies significantly, with newer models generally showing improved performance
    - ChatGPT-4o demonstrates excellent efficiency with high speed (123.9 tokens/sec) and short processing time (6.53 min)

3. Market Implications:
    - Intense competition between major providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) continues to drive rapid innovation
    - Performance of OpenAI's o3-mini demonstrates that smaller, more efficient models can compete with larger counterparts
    - ChatGPT-4o offers a good balance of performance, speed, and cost effectiveness
    - OpenAI o1 (1217) provides strong capabilities but at a higher price point compared to newer models
    - Amazon Nova Pro, while scoring 62.0%, shows promise for enterprise applications as we await the more powerful Amazon Nova Premier model
    - Due to high price of GPT-4.5 preview, it appears OpenAI has decreased the amount of tokens generated in output
    - DeepSeek's open-source models provide viable alternatives for organizations seeking to host their own LLMs

4. Areas for Improvement:
    - Computational efficiency remains a challenge for some models, particularly GPT-4.5 preview with its low speed of 8.59 tokens per second
    - Response quality and consistency across different types of tasks varies significantly
    - Cost-performance balance continues to be a key consideration for model selection, with experimental models currently offering the best value

These findings indicate a maturing market with increasing sophistication in model capabilities. The strong performance of newer models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, o3-mini) suggests a trend
toward both higher performance and greater efficiency. Organizations now have more options to choose from, whether prioritizing overall performance, specific capabilities, deployment flexibility, or
cost-effectiveness, including self-hosting options with open-source models like DeepSeek.
