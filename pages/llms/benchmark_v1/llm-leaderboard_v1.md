# LLMs Leaderboard (Benchmark v1, last update 2025-03-06)

## Introduction

This page compares the effectiveness of Anthropic, Amazon, Google DeepMind, xAI, OpenAI, Meta and DeepSeek companies LLMs in executing software engineering tasks, including code translation, code
generation, documentation generation and
large context instruction following (LCIF).

Our latest research and evaluations have revealed significant shifts in large language model performance. Leading our rankings is Claude 3.7 Sonnet with an impressive 91.9% total score, followed by a
tie between OpenAI's o3-mini model and o1-mini model, both with 91.3%. These models demonstrate exceptional capabilities in software engineering tasks while maintaining efficient processing times and
reasonable costs.

The fourth position is held by Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) with 90.9%, showcasing the benefits of Anthropic's thinking mode feature. Following closely is Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental (0205) at 89.8%,
demonstrating strong performance across evaluation categories. The sixth place is secured by OpenAI o1 (1217) at 88.8%, with Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental (0121) at 88.6% in seventh place,
which maintains competitive performance due to offering very fast execution time.

Anthropic's new Claude 3.7 Sonnet models have reclaimed top positions in our benchmark, demonstrating the company's continued innovation. We are also looking forward to new models from other
providers, including xAI's Grok 3, which has the potential to compete for the lead in our benchmark.

OpenAI's GPT-4.5 preview shows only middle-range results (83.6%). It generates a very small amount of tokens (32,458) while having the highest cost ($75/$150) among all tested models. This may be due
to its preview status or other factors, but currently makes it less efficient than previously released OpenAI models, including GPT-4o which offers better performance at a significantly lower cost.

The current top of Large Language Models based on research, in order of Total Score, are:

1. Claude 3.7 Sonnet - 91.9%
2. OpenAI o3-mini (2025-01-31) - 91.3%
3. OpenAI o1-mini (2024-09-12) - 91.3%
4. Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Thinking) - 90.9%
5. Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental (0205) - 89.8%

You can read [llm-comparison-report.md](llm-comparison-report_v1.md) for a detailed comparison of the models. The report includes all experiment scores, the performance of each model in different
categories, and the final scores.

## Final scores in EPAM's LLMs Benchmark

All categories, except Large Context Instructions Following (LCIF), are evaluated automatically using the Large Language Model<sup>1</sup>
You can read detailed reports on concrete model performance and the areas where each model excels
in [llm-detailed-result](llm-detailed-result).

The table below provides an overview of the experiment, encompassing three categories. Here, you can review the average accuracy and completeness across all categories, total execution time,
total number of input and output tokens (for o1-series models, output tokens include reasoning tokens), the cost of the experiment, and finally, the total score.
The total score comprises the average score across all categories including LCIF experiment score.
