## Quick Summary
GitHub Copilot provides the widest coverage of possible IDEs, although the most awaited features—Workspace and fine-tuning—are still in closed beta testing phase with no clear ETA for public access. Copilot provides telemetry as REST API only, whereas Amazon Q and Gemini integrated monitoring into their cloud consoles (although likely without specific data on suggestions acceptance rates, programming languages used, etc. - only administrative monitoring). No major vendor offers a standalone on-premise tool deployment, except the open-source Continue tool. Google and Amazon integrated their assistants into cloud consoles, providing unique features such as chatting about AWS costs or asking questions about Big Query. Copilot and Gemini released early access to testing integration features with popular enterprise tools like Docker and Atlassian ones, etc.

## Background
Up to the present moment, Generative AI-enabled development tools have already passed quite a remarkable evolutionary path, starting from just being a powerful code completion IntelliSense analog to providing a companion assistant almost like a human that is able to create a plan to solve a task and then execute it. In the first generations, providing just code completion did not efficiently address tasks that inherently required asking free-form questions like bug fixing, refactoring, code explanation, code documentation, and similar. Although many people reported that emulating a dialogue by asking direct questions in the code editor's code comments frequently worked at that time.

Addressing this, starting from mid-2023, tool vendors accelerated integration of chat-based interfaces similar to ChatGPT into their offerings, significantly widening the applicability opportunities. From that moment, Gen AI-enabled development tools started to more actively proliferate ancillary features such as chat-based commands, inline chat, chat history, agentic behaviors, customization, and others. It became apparent that choosing the right tools appeared to be a multidimensional task where deployment, UX, stability, performance, accuracy, and many other similar factors must be considered alongside the cost. *Hence, the purpose of this article is to highlight the key features of contemporary Gen AI-enabled code assistants and provide a comprehensive comparison of the most popular tools from major vendors.*

While evaluating relative efficiency, accuracy, and productivity impact remains a very challenging task on its own, we tried to approach the matter of comparison by analyzing the mere existence of core user-facing features that major vendors provide in their offerings.

## Methodology
Looking at the evolution of the most popular tools and offerings of niche vendors, we developed a set of criteria that addresses almost all the features available to a developer. We also augmented this with some elements of deployment, licensing, administration, and similar features relevant for a software vendor organization in general.

An important note is that most tools still remain closed-source software, and hence some answers were specified relying on publicly available information, which sometimes does not directly provide an answer to the original question posed. For example, a specific LLM that is used in a tool from major software vendors is usually a private build and deployment of some popular LLM like GPT in the case of Copilot. Such a model is not accessible via any public or paid API.

It is also very hard to provide any direct information regarding specific feature implementations and architectures of tools in general because, as vendors claim, many of the features remain their "secret sauce," such as adapting to a developer's choices or discarding a suggestion on the fly. Although there were some attempts to decompile the plugins, their inner workings still remain hidden due to the private nature of such software. For these reasons, none of the tools provide an SDK or an API.

We also left out of scope the security aspects of tools, which will be the subject of specific research, as this entails thoroughly reviewing ToC documents published by vendors and distilling simple information regarding how the communication between the tool and its backend is encrypted, whether the prompts and responses are stored, and used for subsequent retraining of models, among similar concerns.

Where there are specific topics or facts that require more information, the sections below the table shed more light on the subject.

In some rare instances, it was very challenging to obtain detailed information about some specific feature of a tool because it has just been allowed for some limited (i.e., beta) access to selected partners—such as integrations for Gemini Code Assist.

## Participants
We have chosen the most popular tools from the biggest vendors: Microsoft (GitHub), Google, and Amazon. We also included the Continue tool, which shows very good results for accuracy and completeness of suggestions according to our other research. Most of the features in the tools were analyzed predominantly in the Visual Studio Code editor, as vendors tend to release features to their plugins for this exact IDE with the highest priority. Generally, this IDE sees the most feature-rich and stable code assistant plugins. However, we also noticed that in other IDEs, which act as more native ones for many enterprise developers, such as IntelliJ IDEA for Java, the plugin update schedule lags behind state-of-the-art features, making them less feature-rich in comparison to their Visual Studio Code counterparts.

The tools that have been analyzed are:
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) from GitHub
- [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) from Amazon
- [Gemini Code Assist](https://cloud.google.com/products/gemini/code-assist) from Google
- [Continue.dev](https://www.continue.dev/) open source 

## Comparison Categories Description
While the chat interface where developers could ask free-form questions about the code was a long-awaited feature in mid-2023, **by mid-2024, the list of the most important features expected from modern Gen AI-enabled code assistants includes** more advanced ones:
- **Agentic flows**: The most intelligent way to solve the tasks posed by creating a step-by-step plan and then executing it. This usually enables solving much more sophisticated problems than just code completion or talk-to-my-code.
- **Telemetry**: A specific feature that shows analytics regarding how many tool suggestions were accepted, rejected, which programming languages were used the most, etc. This feature is very important for building quantitative models for analyzing the impact of Gen AI tools on development time and efforts.
- **Integrations**: The ability either to feed data from external systems to improve suggestions or create data outside, like tickets in JIRA.
- **Deployment models**: Generally denotes whether a tool and its backend can be deployed in an organization on-premise, which has been a long-awaited feature from day one. However, all tools from major software vendors currently lack this ability, with only the open-source Continue providing such opportunities (the matter of LLM deployment and maintenance still stands in this instance).

While most other categories are self-descriptive, some of them might need a bit of explanation:
- **LLMs used**: Based on publicly available information; however, for closed-source tools, there's no specific answer regarding the exact version/deployment of the LLM for the reasons described above.

**DISCLAIMER**: Although we made every effort to ensure that the information in the table is accurate, due to the highly dynamic nature of the subject and sometimes fragmented communication on the tools' features, some pieces may appear slightly outdated or may not accurately reflect the current state of affairs.
