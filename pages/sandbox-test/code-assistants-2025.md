As of Spring 25 has agentic feature in very heavy development/experimental state. Also lacking some enterprise features like standalone deployment. Improved plugins for JetBrains tools and full Visual Studio - they almost caught on VS Code                                                                  | 88%                               | 89%             | 80%                |

VS Code-based only - which may pose significant limitations for enterprise developers (Java, .NET, front-end) - in such cases may represent an interface to AI features including the agent. Has the most capable agentic feature, although this feature isn't ideal - can solve small to medium tasks with moderate complexity. | 87%                               | 88%             | 80%                |

Provides very wide spectrum of enterprise features like standalone deployment, very wide support of IDE plugins, prompt library, code insights, code search etc. Agentic interface is in heavy development but already is of moderate usefulness/quality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 80%                               | 81%             | 80%                |
