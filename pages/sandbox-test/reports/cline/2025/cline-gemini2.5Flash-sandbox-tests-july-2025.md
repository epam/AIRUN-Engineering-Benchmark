- **IDE:** VS Code

## UX Summary

Responses in the chat window were generated slowly, and in Plan mode, the suggested code wasn't generated. It is necessary to additionally switch to Act mode for the file to be edited with the suggested code, which incurs additional costs for extra requests to the LLM.
